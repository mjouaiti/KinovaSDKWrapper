# KinovaSDKWrapper

This library is wrapper for the Kinova SDK which is anything but user-friendly. This is supposed to make your life easier. If it doesn't, then there's a problem. Please notify me!

The master branch is a wrapper for the Mico 2 SDK V6.0.2. For the Jaco 1 SDK V5.1.0, see the Jaco1V5.1.0 branch.

Some Kinova functions are hardly documented and I have no idea what they are supposed to do or how they are supposed to be used. Any contributions are welcome.

Warning:: You must have a Linux Computer with the Kinova SDK installed.

To compile the library, all you need is "make"
